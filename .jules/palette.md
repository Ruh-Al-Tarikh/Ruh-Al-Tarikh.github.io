**Learning:** In static multi-page sites, navigation consistency is often overlooked. Moving from a non-semantic pipe-separated list to a semantic `<ul>` structure within a labeled `<nav>` significantly improves screen reader navigation. Additionally, a "Skip to main content" link is a fundamental accessibility requirement for keyboard users.
**Action:** Always ensure all pages share a consistent, semantic navigation menu and include a skip-to-content link as the first interactive element.
